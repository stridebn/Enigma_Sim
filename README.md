# Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code for a Enigma Simulator, written by Brennan Stride, and documented with the help of Martin Hernandez-Gamez and Hunter Craig. To use the Simulator, download or clone the project (see below).

# What is the enigma?
The enigma was a machine used by Germany during the second world war to encrypt their communications. This encryption changed daily and was considered impossible to be broken consistently by human codebreakers. (TODO: How machine works)

# Why use this?
Use this program if:
* You are interested in how the enigma functions and want to see it in action
* You have an interest in cryptography
* You have an interest in WWII history

# How To Use
Download or clone the project. The class files are included, so compilation is unnecessary. Open a shell, or use a java file execution program to run the file titled "Enigma". The simulator requires a command line argument specifying the file from which the program will read instructions (see *SETTINGS*). There is a second, optional, command for a file from which to read input. If the command line is blank, the program will fail.
